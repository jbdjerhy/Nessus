# Nessus
# Project Title: Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation with Nessus

## Project Description
This project involves setting up Nessus on Linux virtual machines, conducting vulnerability scans on target systems, and exploring vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment.

## Project Scope
- Install and configure Nessus on Linux virtual machines.
- Perform discovery and network vulnerability scans.
- Investigate and resolve any encountered errors.
- Deploy Metasploitable, a vulnerable intentionally-made system, for testing.
- Configure Nessus on Kali Linux for vulnerability scanning.

## Objectives
1. **Install Nessus on Linux VM:** Successfully set up Nessus on a Linux virtual machine in your VirtualBox lab.
2. **Discovery Scan:** Conduct a discovery scan to identify active hosts and open ports on the network.
3. **Basic Network Vulnerability Scan:** Perform a basic network vulnerability scan to identify common vulnerabilities.
4. **Error Investigation:** Investigate and resolve any errors encountered during the setup and scanning process.
5. **Metasploitable Testing:** Install and configure Metasploitable to provide a target with known vulnerabilities.
6. **Advanced Host Scan:** Run an advanced host scan on Metasploitable to identify vulnerabilities.
7. **Alternative Nessus Setup in Kali:** Set up Nessus in Kali Linux using an alternative method.
8. **Successful Vulnerability Scans:** Successfully log in and perform vulnerability scans using Nessus in Kali Linux.
